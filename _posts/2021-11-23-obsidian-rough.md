One thing that has become clear from doing 1:1 coaching is that Obsidian is a big part of my learning workflow, but I haven't yet covered it in detail on this site! To amend this, I'm going to write a quick post outlining some of my main thoughts re: Obsidian, and also add a screenshare video so I can do a quick tour of my space and show some key features. 

## What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a free note-taking app.

It is part of the new crop of note-taking apps (along with Roam Research and a few others) that use the idea of inter-connected notes, where you define links between notes. 

I highly recommend this video for an overview of what Obsidian can do - you'll only need to watch the first third at first as there's a lot in here!

## Zettelkasten/ Evergreen notes/ Atomic Notes

This follows the "[Zettelkasten](https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/)" idea for taking notes. Andy Matuschak calls them "[Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)", and says they're [a fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be). 

Andy outlines that Evergreen notes are:
1. **Concept-oriented**: i.e. a note is about a single thing (this is probably the key way this method differs from conventional note-taking approaches and will be discussed below)
2. **Well titled**: atomic notes are clearly titled, allowing you to quickly search and open them
3. **Highly connected**: you can define relationships between notes, allowing you to create a web of ideas, discover new connections etc

## Why Obsidian over Roam Research?

I used Roam Research for around 2 years. If you're reading this as a Roam Research user, I implore you to switch:

1. The migration process is surprisingly painless: it took me about 2 hours, and that was with a huge vault
2. Obsidian is free whereas Roam is not
3. Obsidian has all of Roam's features, plus more:
	1. Community plugins: store with some incredible plugins like Kanban, dataview, calendar, advanced tables, Zotero, kindle highlights export... there are an insane number of useful ones. Check out a list of particularly good ones [here](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/plugins/)
	2. Ability to have more than 2 panes open (i.e. you could have 4 notes side-by-side)
	3. A very useful graph view for visualising all your notes and seeing connections
	4. Fantastic & fully featured free mobile app
	5. Very active community & development cycle: see the [official Discord space](https://obsidian.md/community), a really great place to ask questions and chat to likeminded people. There are spaces specifically for Academia, general learning, etc.

## How does this fit into a learning workflow

Whilst Anki is essential for internalising concepts and ensuring you remember them in the long term, a note-taking app is also a key part of a learning workflow. If you're learning a new topic, it makes sense to collate notes from various sources into a space that is easily referenced, searchable, can be added to etc. 

## A quick look at my Obsidian vault
Below is a quick screenshare video I've made to show Obsidian in action.
