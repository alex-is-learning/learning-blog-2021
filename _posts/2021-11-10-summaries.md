I wanted to have a quick summary of each of the key ideas posts as I know they're a little verbose at the moment - the whole "if I had more time I'd have written a shorter letter" syndrome. 

I've also recently learned [Mermaid syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) for making flowcharts which I've been using a lot in Obsidian, and it seems like a great way to make some quick summaries!

## Key Post 1 - Intro & Mission

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
	id1(Lack of<br>learning at<br>school)
	id2(Best ways to learn)
	
	bwtl1(Spaced<br>repetition)
	bwtl2(Active<br>recall)
	bwtl3(Active<br>encoding)

	id3(Anki)
	id4(Profundity of<br>memorisation)
	prof(Harold<br>Bloom)

	id5(Benefits<br>of anki)
	boa1(Learning<br>doesn't<br>degrade)
	boa2(Incremental<br>reading)
	boa3(Growth mindset<br> and belief in<br>ability to learn)

	id1 --> id2
	id2 --> bwtl1
	id2 --> bwtl2
	id2 --> bwtl3
	bwtl1 --> id3
	bwtl2 --> id3
	bwtl3 --> id3
	id3 --> id4
	id4 --> prof
	id4 --> id5
	id5 --> boa1
	id5 --> boa2
	id5 --> boa3

</div>

## Other summary diagrams coming ASAP!
