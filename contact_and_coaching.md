As per this [EA forum post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EktaZtz6DSPbzymjg/free-1-1-learning-coaching), I've started doing a trial run of 1:1 coaching - as of writing this, I had my first session this morning and it went really well!

Please get in touch if you'd be interested in free 1:1 coaching, or if you have anything you'd like to discuss!

### Archetypes:

Based on the emails I've gotten so far, I've come up with 5 "archetypes" of the kind of people I'd coach: the plan is to have a different type of meeting for each so I'm not over- or under-explaining anything. 

1. Brand new to metalearning
2. Read some resources, not implemented
3. Read some resources, early in implementation
4. Intermerdiate metalearner
5. Advanced metalearner
