<p>The aim of this site is to act as a natural extension of the <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> website.</p>

<p>80,000 Hours is a fantastic site for assessing how to choose an impactful career (aligning with <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism</a> values). I want to create a similarly essential site that <strong>outlines how to best develop knowledge</strong>, and also to act as a repository of Effective Altruism flashcards to improve knowledge sharing &amp; retention.</p>

<p>The current aim is to outline the best techniques for learning and gaining knowledge in a short series of blog posts, and to share free flashcard decks related to Effective Altruism for people to use to test meta-learning out for themselves.</p>

<p>I believe that empowering people to gain as much knowledge as possible in their chosen fields will help them increase their impact over their careers.</p>

<p>(Read my <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EwJuWKicdY76rtCsN/utility-of-an-charity-similar-to-80-000-hours-teaching">Effective Altruism Forum post</a> which outlines my original vision/ mission statement)</p>
